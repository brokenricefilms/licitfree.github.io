## mem.ai (new)

- link to the blog: 

## Notion (old)

- Use notion page of course (not indexing to search engine like google, cuz i’m poor)
- These my notion main page

```
> The Gargen of Note (publish, the main page you view see when you click the like i provice)
> Publish (publish note)
> Private (i don’t want show you, for private infomation stuff)
```

- that it! hopefully i will have some cool customize stuff while using notion
- For now trust the basic workflow when i used Vim before

## vim (old)

- I use nvim and [this script to make my life easy](https://github.com/thuanpham2311/vim-zet)
- This my folder structure:
    
```
> note/
> personal/
> publish/
> README.md
```

- I use github private repo for sync my note.
- I use script for copy my `publish/` to this repo
- Crontab for automation stuff, you can see my crontab config [here](https://github.com/thuanpham2311/dotfiles/search?q=crontab), default is every 15m.
- I use shortcut `space + n` in vim for new note following `YYYYMMDDhhmmss.md` to my inbox `note/`, after i will move this note to `publish` or `personal`.
- `[[` in insert mode for linking note
- Daily I review my inbox note note/(new note will be here), once time a day I use [function `hi`](https://github.com/thuanpham2311/dotfiles/blob/7c82f0f8f6565d343731fe9977792f67370ae7a6/zsh/zshrc#L180)
- you can see my old notes at github repo by following this link: <https://github.com/thuanpham2311/garden>
