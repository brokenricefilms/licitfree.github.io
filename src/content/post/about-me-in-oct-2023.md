"Ã”ng Edit" meaning this guys edit in vietnamese also you can type "Ong edit"

My name is Thuan

Day to day i just sitting in the front of my computer, edit, watch stuff. Sometime I go out to smell human or touch grass

I had background from Front-end Dev aka i know how to build the website but i think most of the time this skill help me build stuff i want

In the Sep 2023 i just think again well i kinda boring, i don't level up the programming skill i know how to do that, but i didn't do. So again 4 year ago i in high school i had option to do the programming or design. I take the programming maybe this time like want to be the mr robot :D, but thought year to year i did see my-self improve much in programming

So i take a switch to video editing, again i didn't do anything relate much to video editing in my uni life so yeah keep going hopefully i can enjoy, level up, and live the life i want.

Freedom
