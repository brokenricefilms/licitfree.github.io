"Ã”ng Edit" means this guy edits in Vietnamese also you can type "Ong edit"

My name is Thuan

Day to day I sit in front of my computer, edit, and watch stuff. Sometimes I go out to smell humans or touch grass

I have a background in Front-end Dev aka I know how to build a website but I think most of the time this skill helps me build stuff I want

In Sep 2023 I thought again well i am kinda boring, i don't level up the programming skill i know how to do that, but i didn't. So again 4 years ago i in high school i had the option to do programming or design. I take the programming maybe this time like want to be the Mr. Robot :D, but through year to year i didn't see myself improve much in programming

So i took a switch to video editing, again i didn't do anything related to video editing in my uni life so yeah keep going hopefully i can enjoy, level up, and live the life i want.

Freedom
